   <title>Federal Depository Libraries in the Paths of Tornadoes and Storms </title> 
   <link>
    http://www.fdlp.gov/?id=4070
   </link> 
   <description><![CDATA[<p>A number of Federal depository libraries were in the paths of tornadoes and other storms this week. GPO is committed to helping depository libraries recover in any way that we can.</p>
<p>We are keeping track of libraries in areas that are affected by these disasters and are monitoring any closings so that shipments can be suspended. Once libraries reopen, we will contact them to offer any assistance we can provide.</p>
<p>In the event of a natural or man-made disaster, when safe to do so, depository library staff are asked to inform their regional depository and GPO’s Office of Outreach and Support via <a href="mailto:fdlpoutreach@gpo.gov">email</a> or by phone at (202) 512-1119 if they are closed and when they anticipate reopening. Our staff will be happy to consult with you about maintaining free public access to Government information, arranging for temporary address changes for depository deliveries, and more.</p>
<p>If you have questions about damage assessment, please contact GPO at <a href="mailto:preservefedinfo@gpo.gov">preservefedinfo@gpo.gov</a>. Numerous ‘what to do if…’ information sheets <a href="https://www.fdlp.gov/preservation/preservation-at-gpo">are available</a> from FDLP.gov’s Preservation page with information dealing with water damage, mold, or access restrictions that might be caused by these storms.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, our staff will be happy to consult with you about lost or damaged items. We will keep the larger depository community informed as relief efforts continue over time.</p><br /><a href="http://www.fdlp.gov/?id=4070" target="_blank">Read more ...</a>]]>

<p>The DLC sought the opinions, comments, and questions of the broader depository library community during a <a href="https://www.fdlp.gov/spring-2019-depository-library-council-virtual-meeting">discussion session</a> of its virtual meeting in April 2019.

   <title>Office of Technology Assessment Funding for FY20</title> 
   <link>
    http://www.fdlp.gov/?id=4052
   </link> 
   <description><![CDATA[<p>The latest <a href="https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/FY2020%20Leg%20Branch%20Sub%20Markup%20Draft.pdf" title="FY 2020 legislative branch appropriations bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FY 2020 legislative branch appropriations bill</a> includes $6 million in initial funding to restore the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), which was defunded more than 20 years ago. Advocates say it could help Congress understand emerging technology and its social and policy implications.</p>
<p>The OTA provided Congress with analysis of technology issues from 1972 to 1995. The agency’s mission was to ensure lawmakers had the information they needed on new or expanding technologies and objective information assessing impacts, policy proposals, and scientific expertise “to match that of the executive branch.”</p>
<p>The University of North Texas (UNT) Libraries’ CyberCemetery contains the <a href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ota/default.htm" title="OTA historic collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OTA historic collection</a>, including documents and videos. The CyberCemetery is an archive of Government websites that have ceased operation (usually websites of defunct Government agencies and commissions that have issued a final report). GPO and UNT created a partnership to provide permanent public access to the websites and publications of defunct U.S. Government agencies and commissions.</p>

   <title>Bibliographic Records for Online Versions of the FDLP Basic Collection on GitHub Repository</title> 
   <link>
    http://www.fdlp.gov/?id=4050
   </link> 
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Library Services and Content Management (LSCM) has added a bibliographic record set for the Basic Collection to the <a href="https://github.com/usgpo/cataloging-records" title="CGP on GitHub repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CGP on GitHub repository</a>. The set of 21 bibliographic records represents the online versions of the resources on the <a href="https://www.fdlp.gov/requirements-guidance/collections-and-databases/1442-basic-collection" title="FDLP Basic Collection">FDLP Basic Collection</a> list. These are resources that every library in the FDLP is required to have accessible for the public’s immediate use, because the titles are vital sources of information supporting the public's right to know about the workings and essential activities of their Federal Government.

   <title>Monthly Maintenance for the CGP This Wednesday</title> 
   <link>
    http://www.fdlp.gov/?id=4046
   </link> 
   <description><![CDATA[<p>The Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP), MetaLib, and Federal Depository Library Directory (FDLD) will undergo routine maintenance from Wednesday, May 8, 2019 at 6:00 p.m. (Eastern) through Thursday, May 9, 2019 at 6:00 a.m. (Eastern). During the maintenance period, these services may experience brief, intermittent downtime.</p>
<p>The CGP, MetaLib, and the FDLD undergo regularly-scheduled monthly maintenance, usually every third Wednesday of every month. This allows for regular performance and security updates, which ensure long-term uptime and reliability of our services. This month due to the number and type of updates needed, we are scheduling it earlier in the month and for a longer duration.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation, and we apologize for the inconvenience.</p><br /><a href="http://www.fdlp.gov/?id=4046" target="_blank">Read more ...</a>]]>

   <title>Two Weeks Left - Survey on U.S. Code Annual Supplements</title> 
   <link>
    http://www.fdlp.gov/?id=4045
   </link> 
   <description><![CDATA[<p>There are just two weeks left to participate in the survey of Federal depository libraries on the use of the United States Code (USC) (Y 1.2/5:) and its supplements. GPO’s Office of the Superintendent of Documents is working with the Office of the Law Revision Counsel (OLRC) of the U.S. House of Representatives to conduct the survey. OLRC is the office that produces the USC, and they are investigating whether it can be produced more efficiently by eliminating printed USC annual supplements.</p>
<p>The USC and its annual supplements have been distributed through the FDLP since 1940. Today nearly 700 depository libraries receive the tangible version of the USC, and nearly 1,000 select the online format. This makes Federal depository libraries well suited for offering comments and responding to the survey.</p>
<p>The OLRC wants to continue to serve the needs of its users, and your completion of the survey will provide important feedback. The Superintendent of Documents encourages all depository libraries to participate.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JQSPBNL" title="complete the survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete the survey</a> by <strong>May 20, 2019</strong>. You may <a href="https://www.fdlp.gov/file-repository/collection-management/3876-fdlp-survey-united-states-code-elimination-of-printed-annual-supplements?utm_source=newsletter_1848&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=depository-library-survey-u-s-code-annual-supplements" title="review a copy of the survey">review a copy of the survey</a> before you begin.

   <title>LSCM’s Response to PCC’s New Policy on ISBD Punctuation</title> 
   <link>
    http://www.fdlp.gov/?id=4043
   </link> 
   <description><![CDATA[<p>In response to the Program for Cooperative Cataloging’s (PCC) recent announcement about the new policy on ISBD punctuation in bibliographic records, LSCM will exercise the option to continue the current practice of including terminal periods at the end of descriptive fields. For complete information on the policy, please consult PCC’s <a href="http://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/documents/guidelines-terminal-periods.pdf" title="Link to policy guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy guidelines</a> and <a href="http://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/documents/final_punctuation_all_MARC_field.xlsx" title="Link to spreadsheet of fields" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spreadsheet of fields</a> eligible for the new policy.</p>
<p>While LSCM staff will retain terminal punctuation in their original cataloging, the PCC policy does stipulate that when cataloging staff update a PCC record, they must maintain the original punctuation pattern in the record. LSCM will not add omitted periods in descriptive fields when exporting records from OCLC to the CGP. Therefore some GPO records will reflect the new policy and contain descriptive fields without terminal periods. LSCM’s Projects and Systems staff have confirmed that the presence of records without terminal periods in some descriptive fields will not impact the CGP in any way.</p>
<p>If you have any questions and concerns, please submit them through <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/askgpo" title="Link to askGPO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">askGPO</a>, under the category, Federal Depository Libraries, and the subcategory, Cataloging.</p><br /><a href="http://www.fdlp.gov/?id=4043" target="_blank">Read more ...</a>]]>

<li><strong>Learning outcomes</strong>: Government data is available on the web in many different formats. Documents in PDF, static pages or dynamic search results can be difficult to transfer into interactive formats such as .CSV or Excel. Most software tools for harvesting internet content belong to computer experts. However, journalists, marketing analysts, and information professionals use simple web-scraping techniques to harvest internet data tables. This webinar will demonstrate a small number of simple tools librarians can use to harvest usable data from Government websites.</li>

<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jane Canfield, Coordinator of Federal Documents, Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico</li>
<li><strong>Learning outcomes:</strong> “<em>All work and no play make Jack a dull boy</em>” is an old expression that many of us know. This webinar will provide information on Government resources on leisure time, vacation planning, and hobbies. Topics covered will include hobbies which can help the disabled and avoid dementia. Hobbies can also be a source of extra income. Vacation time is important to maintain balance in our lives, and this webinar will offer resources from agencies such as OSHA and explore the science of leisure time with information from sources like PubMed. And to add a touch of fun, we’ll pay a virtual visit to some of our national parks which offer great vacation and leisure time activities. So join us for a fun and informative webinar, and of course, it will include some sources of hobby and vacation information for your users who speak other languages.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Expected level of knowledge for participants:</strong> No prerequisite knowledge required</li>
